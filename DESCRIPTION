Description: Functional differences between the cerebral hemispheres 
    are a fundamental characteristic of the human brain. Researchers 
    interested in studying these differences often infer underlying 
    hemispheric dominance for a certain function (e.g., language) from 
    laterality indices calculated from observed performance or brain 
    activation measures . However, any inference from observed measures 
    to latent (unobserved) classes has to consider the prior probability 
    of class membership in the population. The provided functions 
    implement a Bayesian model for predicting hemispheric dominance from
    observed laterality indices (Sorensen and Westerhausen, Laterality: 
    Asymmetries of Body, Brain and Cognition, 2020, <doi:10.17605/OSF.IO/MKWCR>).
